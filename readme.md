# Eat-Da-Burger
I have created web page using mysql node.js express.js html css bootstrap and deployed it on heroku. This web apps saves input from the feild and saves it into a list which shows what burgers are left to eat. This data is saved into a mysql databse. Within this list is a button which will let you update the the the data into another list. This list shows which burgers you have eaten. This will update the data in the mysql database
